<li><b>Third Party Cookies</b> 

<p>When you visit the Website a snippet of code (often called a "pixel", "beacon" or "tag") may set or retrieve an anonymous user ID stored in a cookie on your computer by a third party advertising network. By assigning a single anonymous user ID that can be accessed by any website, these companies enable advertisers to target appropriate adverts to you across a large network of websites and monitor which adverts you see. 
  </p>
<p>This data is completely anonymous and associated only with your browser / device. 99sound.com will not supply any personal information we may also have about you. In some cases, these advertising networks may receive your IP address as part of the process of displaying adverts, but this is not data 99sound.com will provide.
</p>
<p>These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don\'t have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users). If you wish to block third party cookies, you can do so in your browser\'s security settings - indeed, the majority of browsers will block them by default. 
</p>
<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
